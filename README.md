# ATLAS-Particle-Physics-Project

These are some of the code I created for my ATLAS Particle Physics project at Manchester. I worked with the ATLAS Open Data and developed discriminator functions to select signal and background events. I worked in a LINUX environment and used C++ & ROOT for the project.

Unfortunately I did not manage this project using github, so some files are lost.
